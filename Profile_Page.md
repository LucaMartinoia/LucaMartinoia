# About me
### Short intro
I obtained my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Genova (Italy), and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher there. In september I will move with my wife Valeria - who is a postdoctoral researcher in classics - to the University of Padova.

### Research interests
My research interests lie at the intersection between high-energy, statistical and condensed matter physics. The topic of my Ph.D. has been the theory of hydrodynamics and its extensions, in particular what happens when the charges of the system are only approximately conserved. Recently I am developing a strong interest in active and soft matter, while soon I will also start working on neuroscience and theoretical ecology.

### Hobbies
I like mountains in all seasons, particularly hiking and skiing. On a more day-to-day basis, I enjoy videogames (in particular Soulsborne-like ones), TV series and cooking pizzas.
