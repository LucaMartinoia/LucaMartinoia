# About me
### Short intro
I obtained my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Genova, then I moved to the University of Padova as a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical neuroscience. After my postdoc in Padova I left the academia and moved to an industry position. I am now working as Project Engineer at [STAM S.r.l.](https://www.stamtech.com/), doing research within the Horizon Europe program in Air Traffic Management and Defence.

### Research interests
My research interests lie at the intersection between high-energy, statistical and condensed matter physics. My research focuses mostly on the theory of hydrodynamics and its extensions, in particular what happens when the charges of the system are only approximately conserved. Recently, I am developing a strong interest in the hydrodynamic description of active and soft matter. While in Padova, I also worked on stochastic neural networks and linear response theory.

### Hobbies
I like mountains in all seasons, particularly hiking and skiing. On a more day-to-day basis, I enjoy videogames (in particular Soulsborne-like ones), TV series and cooking pizzas.
